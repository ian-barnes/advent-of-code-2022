I'm using this as an opportunity to learn [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/):

> Elixir is a dynamic, functional language for building scalable and maintainable
> applications.
>
> Elixir runs on the Erlang VM, known for creating low-latency, distributed, and
> fault-tolerant systems. These capabilities and Elixir tooling allow developers to be
> productive in several domains, such as web development, embedded software, data
> pipelines, and multimedia processing, across a wide range of industries.

Elixir was recommended to me by [Xavier](https://github.com/eXenon), who gave a
[presentation about it](https://exenon.github.io/elixir-presentation). To be honest, it
doesn't seem very well-suited to solving this sort of problem. Python would have been much
easier.

Structure of the repo may change as I learn the tooling. For now, if for some insane
reason you wanted to run any of these, you'd `cd` into the relevant directory and then run
`elixir day_n.exs`. Output will be four lines:

1. the answer for the sample data for part one,
2. the actual answer for part one,
3. the sample for part two,
4. the actual answer for part two.
