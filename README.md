See <https://adventofcode.com/>.

## Elixir

I'm using Advent of Code 2022 as an opportunity to learn
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/). Elixir was recommended to me by
[Xavier](https://github.com/eXenon), who gave us at Cryptosense a
[presentation](https://exenon.github.io/elixir-presentation) about it a while ago.

## Setup

This is now set up as a Mix library project. To run everything, just say `mix`.

## CI

Tests now run automatically in CI on every push; see workflow defined in
[`elixir.yml`](https://github.com/ian-barnes/advent-of-code-2022/blob/main/.github/workflows/elixir.yml).
There's even a pretty CI status badge at the top of this page!
