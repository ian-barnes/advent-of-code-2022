# AdventOfCode2022

See <https://adventofcode.com/>.

I'm using Advent of Code as an opportunity to learn [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/):

Elixir was recommended to me by [Xavier](https://github.com/eXenon), who gave us a
[presentation](https://exenon.github.io/elixir-presentation) about it a while ago.

This is now set up as a Mix library project. To run everything, just say `mix`.
